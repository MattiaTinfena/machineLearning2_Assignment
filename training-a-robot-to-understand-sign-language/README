This dataset is a repositpry of sign language images taken by the Anki Vector
robot. To understand the American sign language for the ENglish alphabet,
please take a look at the following video:

Extract:
To extract please follow the followong steps
gzip -d signlanguage.tar.gz
tar -xvf signlanguage.tar

Organizations:
The dataet contains roughly 8500 images. Images are labelled according to the
sign language, for e.g. all images with a_*.png are labels for pictures with
sign for the alphabet 'a' taken by vector. All images for the background (with
no sign) are labelled as background_a.

Details:
The images are captured using the following program:
https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/experimental/sign_language_recognition_system/data_gen.py

This program captures a 200x200 Black and white image of a hand sign centered
on Vector's camera feed. The images were captured at different times of the
day and for different lighting conditions.

Challenge:
Use these images to build a model which can predict a hand sign using the
forllowing program provided with teh Vector SDk:
